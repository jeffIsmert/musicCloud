webII project documentation

this project was to create an online music library using Django and its built in database system. this is my first time using most of the features in the project such as Django itself and jQuery, even GitHub!!! so far I have been following a few tutorials online and have the django and database side working fairly well. now i am working on the front end and how to get the music to play directly on the page with personal audio tags... so far little luck.
